# NUS Orbital 2023 (Team name: Nusevents)

Orbital (Independent Software Development Project) is NUS School of Computing self-directed, independent work course. This programme gives students the opportunity to pick up software development skills on their own, using sources on the web. Our team members consist of Sai Utkarsh and Ching Kwun Hei.

**Proposed Level of Achievement:** Apollo 11

### Introducing Nusevents

A cross-platform mobile application (written in React Native) to help students living in NUS know about the events happening in their residencies and for those hosting these events, to effectively publicise them to the students living there.

### Motivation

Imagine this scenario : you’re free for an hour on a Wednesday night. You live on campus and want to join a cca/ interest group event or attend any hall/college event. However, you’re not sure what event is happening at that point of time. You scour through the countless telegram groups and channels and text all your friends just to figure this out. By the time you find out what's happening, it has already ended. There has to be a better way! There should be a platform where you can access this information easily and conveniently, for example through an event calendar!

Imagine another scenario : You recently created a new CCA for your hall/RC and put in a lot of work to make the first event a success. However, very few people even saw the invitation for the first event as it was hidden under spam in the various telegram chats. Turn up was very low and you believe that people in your hall/RC are not interested. However in reality, this is not the case! There just isn't an efficient platform where individuals can view information about the events happening in their hall/RC!


### Aims

We hope to create a platform where NUS students can create, access and interact with information about various types of events in their residencies. This is done through an NUSevents mobile application, on iOS and Android.

With these, students will not miss out on the any events happening in their residencies and would be able to live their university lives to the fullest. Organisers and hosts of these events will be able to publicise their events effectively as well!

### Key Features

There are 2 types of accounts - Business Accounts and Personal Accounts. Upon creation of either account, they have to indicate which residency they are from, from a selection provided to them. Each residency has its own microenvironment - Personal Accounts can only view events created by Business Accounts from their residency etc.

Business Accounts include CCAs (eg Tembusu Football or Sheares Dance Club) or Committes (eg Tembusu Arts Committee) or it can be the residency itself (eg Pioneer House).

Business Account will have a "Create" page, where they can create events or announcements.
These Business Accounts can create events, for example Tembusu Football try-outs or Sheares Dance Club Annual Performance. They key in the date, time, venue and a short description of the event. They can even add pictures. The onus of availability of the venue in question is on the organiser of the event. 
Business Accounts can also create announcements, for example if they changed venue at the eleventh hour. 
Announcements and Events can be tagged as "IMPORTANT". When tagged, they will appear on the Personal Accounts' (that follow them) home pages.
Events and Announcements can be edited anytime after publishing, or deleted.

Naturally, there is a "My Events" page, where business accounts can access and view all the events they created. 
Here, they can view the Personal Accounts that signed up for their event (by pressing the "I'm in!" button. A rough gauge of attendance can be easily obtained prior to the event.



Personal Accounts include individuals - students and fellows - living in the residency. When they first create their account, they will have a list of all Business Accounts in their residencies (that they can search for, through name or category). They can then choose to follow whichever accounts they are interested in. Only events and annoouncements from their residency will appear on their home or Events page.

Firstly, personal accounts have a "Home" page. Here, they can view all announcements and events tagged as "IMPORTANT" by Business Accounts followed. They can also favourite a Business Account, and all events/announcements from those accounts will appear on Home page (eg a person really interested in Football)

Seccondly, there will be a "Create Individual Events" page. Personal Accounts can also create Individually created events, such as invitation for supper. 

There will be an "Events" page, where one can view all upcoming events created by Business Accounts followed, either in list mode or calendar mode.

Naturally, there will be a "Individual Events" page where one can view the same for upcoming events created by Personal Accounts.

For all events, when clicked on, will reveal more information. There will also be an "I'm in" button, which when pressed will register the Personal Account's attendance for the event.

There is an "All" page, where accounts can follow/unfollow/favourite/unfavourite Business Accounts tied to their residency.

For both accounts, there is a settings page where one can change profile picture, email, password or delete account.



## User Stories

As an individual, I would love to have a platform where I can see all the various events occurring within my residency. I wish to know to know about only certain events and not others. I also want to be able to click on the event to know more about it, as right now it is done within telegram chats that are hard to follow with spam messages or telegram channels which are not easy to follow as each committee/society/CCA has their own ones. 

As an individual, I want a separate page to view, create and interact with Individually-created events in my residency (e.g. supper invites).

As a person creating an event, be it individual or otherwise, I want my event to be effectively publicised to students in my residency.

As a person who has created an event, be it individual or otherwise, I want there to be an “I’m in” button, which will enable me to gauge the number of people coming.
